Steps to run Hadoop Map Reduce Program : WordCount

Step 1. Launch Eclipse and set the Eclipse Workspace.
Step 2. To create the Hadoop MapReduce Project, click on File >> New >> Java Project.
Provide the Project Name: WordCount
Click Finish to create the project.
Step 3. Create a new Package right-click on the Project Name(WordCount) >> New >> Package.
Provide the package name: org.myorg
Click Finish to create the package.
Step 4. Add the Hadoop libraries (jars).
Right-Click on Project Name(WordCount) >>Build Path>> configure Build Path.
Add the External jars.
For this go to hadoop-3.1.2>> share >> hadoop.
Now we will move to share >> Hadoop in Hadoop MapReduce Project.
i.	Add the client jar files. Select client jar files and click open.
ii.	Add common jar files. Select common jar files and click open.
iii.	Add common/lib libraries. Select common/lib jars and click open.
iv.	Add yarn jar files. Select yarn jar files and click open.
v.	Add MapReduce jar files. Select MapReduce jar file and click open.
vi.	Add HDFS jar files. Select HDFS jar files and click open.
Click on Apply and Close to add all the Hadoop jar files.
Now, we have added all required jar files in our project.
Step 5. Now create a new class that performs the map job.
In our program WordCountMapper is the class for performing the mapping task.
Right-Click on Package Name >> New >> Class
Provide the class name: WordCountMapper 
Click Finish.
Write the Mapper code and save it.
Step 6. Now create another class (in the same way as we used above), for creating a class that performs the reduce job.
In our program, WordCountReducer is the class to perform the reduce task.
Right-Click on Package Name >> New >> Class
Provide the class name: WordCountReducer 
Click Finish.
Write the Reducer code and save it.
Step 7. Now create the driver class, which contains the main method. In our program, the driver class for the project is named “WordCount”.
Click Finish.
Write the Driver Code and save it.
Step 8. Once the build is successful, execute the project by right-clicking the class and select
Run As – Run Configurations  from the menu.
Double-click the “Java Applications” from the opened window.
The main class will have org.myorg.WordCount as main class as we have created package
Navigate to the “Arguments” tab and add the arguments in the provided space if your Mapreduce program has to get arguments at runtime.
Give one argument i.e input file path and output directory path 
/home/hadoop/input.txt	/home/hadoop/Output/
click “Run”. Execution will be completed
Output will be displayed in the path specified in argument we can open and check the output
